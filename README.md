# EVM Smart Contract Practice

This repository contains my learning and practice work related to
Solidity and EVM-based smart contracts.

I am currently building foundational understanding of:
- Solidity basics
- Smart contract structure
- Access control and safety checks
- Common smart contract vulnerabilities (conceptual)

This repository will be updated with relevant practice code and
task-specific submissions.
